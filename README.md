## Introduction

Nano, is a fairly simple and easy to use text editor;  
especially, when compared to using far more 'complex' text editors such as: Vim/Emacs/-etc.  

However, like many editors...it does have a number of 'hidden' features...which beginners tend to come across learning over time...;  
such as how to add line numbers/-etc.
